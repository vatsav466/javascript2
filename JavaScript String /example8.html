<!-- JavaScript Strings as Objects
Normally, JavaScript strings are primitive values, created from literals:
let x = "John";
But strings can also be defined as objects with the keyword new:

let y = new String("John"); -->




<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<body>

<h1>JavaScript Strings</h1>

<p id="demo"></p>

<script>
// x is a string
let x = "John";

// y is an object
let y = new String("John");

document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML =
typeof x + "<br>" + typeof y;
</script>
